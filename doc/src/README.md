Prism is a new verifiable authentication standard for private messaging and any systems relying on PKI.

With [Celestia](https://celestia.org) underneath, Prism enables users to *instantly and directly* verify their encrypted chats and other services from any device, replacing trusted intermediaries with embedded light nodes.

Next to messaging, we envison many other use cases:
- A shared global identity layer
- Universal keystore rollups
- Decentralized password managers
- New TEE remote attestation protocols
- Advancements to CA and PKI systems
- Dark Rollups

This website serves to provide documentation for the current iteration of the protocol, context for open problems that are being discussed, and general information regarding the status of the project.
