# Deimos: Transparency Dictionary - Rust Implementation

## ðŸŒ• Overview

This project is a Rust-based implementation of a Transparency Dictionary, strongly inspired by descriptions in [Tzialla et. al](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1263.pdf). It offers a secure, scalable solution for managing a label-value map in environments where the service maintaining the map is not completely trusted. The system ensures the integrity and authenticity of operations using cryptographic proofs.

## ðŸŒ– Features

-	Robust Security: Leverages indexed Merkle trees and zkSNARKs to protect against unauthorized data modifications.
-	Efficient Verification: Offers O(log n) proofs of membership/non-membership ensuring minimal verification time.
-	Scalability: Optimized for large-scale applications, capable of managing millions of labels with low overhead.
-	Rust-Based: Implemented in Rust, offering strong memory safety and performance benefits.



## ðŸŒ— Usage

TBD ... something like "The library is designed to be user-friendly, with clear APIs for interacting with the transparency dictionary. Example code snippets are provided to demonstrate basic operations like adding, retrieving, and verifying entries."

## ðŸŒ˜ Installation

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you need a working database. A reference implementation with Redis is supported. The use of a data availability layer is also required. A reference implementation with Celestia is available for this project, which is a very cost efficient and lightweight blockchain solution and on which the cryptographic commitments and the zero-knowledge proofs are posted and verified by light clients. We are planning further reference implementations; for the moment, we are showing the process and installation of the existing implementations and, based on this, the launch of Deimos.

### Install Redis

Redis serves as a powerful in-memory database that is used to store the label-value pairs. Follow these steps to install Redis:

1. Download Redis from [Redis Download Page](https://redis.io/download/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

You don't have to start redis on your own, Deimos is doing that job for you.

### Install Celestia

A DA layer such as Celestia is an important component for data security and availability. It stores the cryptographic commitments and parameters of the zkSNARKs and ideally enables them to be verified. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/rollkit/local-celestia-devnet) to deploy a local testnet.

### Starting the sequencer

If redis is installed and the local devnet is running, Deimos can be started. Deimos can be started in two different ways, as a sequencer (which creates the proofs later on;TODO: more info and link to documentation needed) or as a lightclient (to verify the proofs posted on Celestia using the cryptographic commitments). To start the sequencer, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run sequencer
```

to start the light-client, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run light-client
```

You can then interact with Deimos via the interfaces defined in [webserver.rs](https://github.com/deltadevsde/deimos/blob/main/src/webserver.rs). Based on the data exchanged or stored via the interface the global indexed merkle tree changes and proofs based on these changes then are created in defined epochs (currently 60 seconds) and cryptographic commitments including the proof parameters are posted in the Celestia namespace.

## ðŸŒ‘ Contributions

Contributions are welcome! I saw a lot of contribution guidelines so we need some and write: "Please refer to our contributing guidelines for information on how to submit pull requests, report issues, and contribute to the codebase."
