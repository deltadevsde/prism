# Deimos: Transparency Dictionary - Rust Implementation

## Overview

This project is a Rust-based implementation of a Transparency Dictionary, strongly inspired by descriptions in [Tzialla et. al](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1263.pdf). It offers a secure, scalable solution for managing a label-value map in environments where the service maintaining the map is not completely trusted. The system ensures the integrity and authenticity of operations using cryptographic proofs.

## Features

-	Robust Security: Leverages indexed Merkle trees and zkSNARKs to protect against unauthorized data modifications.
-	Efficient Verification: Offers O(log n) proofs of membership/non-membership ensuring minimal verification time.
-	Scalability: Optimized for large-scale applications, capable of managing millions of labels with low overhead.
-	Rust-Based: Implemented in Rust, offering strong memory safety and performance benefits.



## Usage

TBD ... something like "The library is designed to be user-friendly, with clear APIs for interacting with the transparency dictionary. Example code snippets are provided to demonstrate basic operations like adding, retrieving, and verifying entries."

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! I saw a lot of contribution guidelines so we need some and write: "Please refer to our contributing guidelines for information on how to submit pull requests, report issues, and contribute to the codebase."
